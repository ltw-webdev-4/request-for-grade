# Request for grade

## Overview

Since we’ve been working on the same project all term I’d like you to write a rationale explaining why your pattern library perfectly represents an eCommerce website & complete the associated rubric.

Explain how it fully encompasses all the possible components that are needed to make the whole website—even the pages that we didn’t make ourselves.

- Does it fully represent all the possible components & their variations?
- Does it fully explain everything to someone else?
- Could another person in class jump in and code a new page without asking you questions? Did your teammate struggle to make the product details page?
- Are there components that are missing or incomplete?
- How did you find the process? Give a little personal reflection on the term, the project & the code.

**Fill out the rubric, tally the points & give yourself a grade.** Explain to me **why** you deserve the grade you assigned yourself.

*Be honest with yourself and with me (I’ll notice if you’re not).*

**I will read your explanation while looking over your pattern library. If your feedback is honest and just, you will receive the mark you chose.**

## Marking rubric

Below is the rubric of expectations for this project. **You will be assigned a percentage based on your standing within the rubric.**

| | 0 points | 1 points | 2 points | 3 points |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Style & design** | Incomplete, bland, generic | Mismatched patterns, poorly designed, poorly conceived | Most patterns match and are well designed | Fantastic: the whole pattern library feels cohesive & well designed |
| **Patterns** | Absolute minimum patterns | Some unique patterns, mostly incomplete, poorly structured, poorly planned patterns | Only patterns needed for the template pages, couldn’t make a whole website | All imagined patterns, including patterns not used on the template pages |
| **Explanations** | Missing or incomplete | Mostly complete, bad grammar, spelling mistakes | Complete but not helpful | Excellent & clear, perfect for another person to work from |
| **Accessibility** | Not accessibile | Some accessibility but doesn’t work well with certain situations | Some minor accessibility problems | Works really well under all the standard accessibility tests |
| **Semantics** | Very little HTML | Basic HTML tags chosen | Good variety and appropriate HTML tags chosen | Excellent demonstration of HTML tags and correct use |
| **Responsiveness** | Not responsive | Works on some screens | Responsive but with lots of awkwardness | Looks great on all screen sizes |
| **Code quality** | Missing or incomplete | Poorly done, rushed, no semantics, bad accessibility | Decent: semantics, indentation & accessibility | Perfect: semantics, indentation & accessibility |
| **Git & commits** | Bad commit messages | Decent messages | Good messages | Excellent and descriptive commit messages |

**Rubric totals to 24 points.**
